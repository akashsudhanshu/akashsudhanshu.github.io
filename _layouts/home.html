    <p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Akash, a Master's candidate majoring in Mathematics at IISc, Bangalore, working in low-dimensional topology and geometry. I am being advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/subhojoy/home" class="subhojoy-link">Prof. Subhojoy Gupta</a>.</p>
    <p>My research interest lies in TeichmÃ¼ller spaces, their metric structures, and Riemann surfaces. I've worked on the Bounded Distortion Conjecture proposed by R.C. Penner, quasiconformal maps, and the Weil-Petersson metric. I am currently learning about various aspects of TeichmÃ¼ller theory and computational methods in quasiconformal geometry.</p>
