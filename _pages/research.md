I am interested in Teichmüller theory, Riemann Surfaces and complex geometry.

### Current Work

- **Kähler geometry of the Weil–Petersson metric**  
  Mentor: Prof. Sumio Yamada<br>
  Studying to understand the Wolpert's formula for the Weil-Petersson's metric. Current goal is to write an expository article describing the Weil Petersson's metric from metric and symplectic point of view. Currently, reading about Fenchel Nielson deforations. 
- **Bounded Distortion Conjecture for Once-punctured Torus** 
Mentor: Prof. Subhojoy Gupta<br>
  Bounded Distotion Conjecture in Decorated Teichuller theory was proposed by R.C. Penner. We have found it to be False for once-punctured Torus. Currently, we are doing further analysis to show its false for all branched coverings of once-punctured torus which will show its False for many hyperbolic Surfaces. And we are writing a paper on it alongside.
  
### Bachelor's Thesis

- **Decorated Teichmüller theory: Towards Bounded Distortion Conjecture**
Mentor: Prof. Subhojoy Gupta<br>
  I wrote a review of the Bounded Distortion Conjecture that was proposed by R.C. Penner in an algorithmic way and defined certain things rigorously. The conjecture is about two methods that give ideal cell decompositions of the Decorated Teichmüller space. Penner brought these two methods together into a single self-map on the decorated Teichmüller space relating a combinatorial construction with Jenkins-Strebel differentials. 
  He conjectured that the self-map had a bounded distortion under the Teichmüller metric in an appropriate sense for all hyperbolic surfaces.
