### Research Interests
I am interested in Geometry and Topology with particular research interests in Teichmüller Theory, Complex Dynamics and Complex Geometry.

### Ongoing Projects
**Bounded Distortion Conjecture for Punctured Surfaces**<br>
  (Masters and Bachelors Thesis) <br>
  Mentor: *Prof. Subhojoy Gupta* <br>
  - The Bounded Distortion Conjecture proposed by R.C. Penner for punctured surfaces concerns the Teichmuller distortion of a combinatorial transformation from (decorated) hyperbolic structures to (decorated) singular-flat structures of a surface. <br>
  - We proved that the __conjecture is false__: the Teichmüller distortion is not uniformly bounded on the (decorated) Teichmuller space of any punctured surfaces with positive genus. <br>
  - First, we proved that the distortion is unbounded for a once-punctured torus. Then, we proved the __naturality__ of the transformation with respect to (unbranched) covering maps. This extends the result to all punctured surfaces with positive genus. Currently, we are writing a *research paper* on these results and working on the remaining cases of punctured spheres and bordered
surfaces to prove the analogous result.<br>
  
**Dynamics of Schwarz Christoffel mapping**<br>
Mentor: _Prof. Subhojoy Gupta_ , _Prof. Maxime Bourque_<br>
- It concerns the dynamics of Schwarz Christoffel mappings from discs to Euclidean polygons and ideal polygons in hyperbolic disc.<br>
- Using simulations, we (computationally) showed that the square is **an attracting fixed point** for the iterative mapping from the disc to Euclidean rectangles. Currently, we are studying litrature about SCT maps to ideal quadrilaterals in hyperbolic discs.  
  
### Previous Projects
- **Two perspectives at the Weil-Petersson metric on the Teichmüller space**<br>
  Mentor: Prof. Sumio Yamada<br>
  I studied the Weil–Petersson metric from both hyperbolic metrics and complex-analytic models of Teichmüller space, how these two models are interrelated and proofs of the Kählerity in both settings.
  
- **Foundations of Complex Geometry**<br>
  Mentor: Dr. Purvi Gupta<br>
  I studied about analytic varieties, sheaf cohomology, de Rham and Dolbeault theorems, vector bundles.
  
- **Introduction to Algebraic Topology**<br>
  Mentor: Prof. Siddhartha Gadgil<br>
  I covered the 1st chapter of Hatcher's book on Algebraic Topology and learnt about simplicial complexes, covering spaces and deck transformations.
  
- **Multivariable Calculus and Fourier Analysis**<br>
   Mentor: Dr. Arka Mallick<br>
  I covered the 3 chapter of Stein and Shakarchi's book on Fourier Analysis and learnt about wave and heat equations, Fourier series,   kernels and some convergence theorems.
