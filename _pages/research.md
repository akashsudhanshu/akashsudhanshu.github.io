I am interested in Teichmüller theory, Riemann Surfaces and complex geometry.

### Current Work

- **Kähler geometry of the Weil–Petersson metric**  
  Mentor: Prof. Sumio Yamada.

  Studying to understand the Wolpert's formula for the Weil-Petersson's metric. Current goal is to write an expository article describing the Weil Petersson's metric from metric and symplectic point of view. Currently, reading about Fenchel Nielson deforations. 
- **Bounded Distortion Conjecture for Once-punctured Torus** 
Mentor: Prof. Subhojoy Gupta
  Bounded Distotion Conjecture in Decorated Teichuller theory was proposed by R.C. Penner. We have found it to be False for once-punctured Torus. Currently, we are doing further analysis to show its false for all branched coverings of once-punctured torus which will show its False for many hyperbolic Surfaces. And we are writing a paper on it alongside.
  
### Bachelor's Thesis

- **Decorated Teichmüller theory: Towards Bounded Distortion Conjecture**
Mentor: Prof. Subhojoy Gupta

  Wrote a review of the Bounded Distortion Conjecture which was proposed by R.C. Penner. R.C. Penner defined a self-map on the decorated Teichmüller space relating a combinatorial construction and Strebel differentials.
  He asked if the map had a bounded distortion with respect to the  Teichmüller metric.
