I am interested in Teichmüller theory, Riemann Surfaces and complex geometry.

### Current Work
- **Bounded Distortion Conjecture for Once-punctured Torus**
  (Master's Thesis) <br>
  Mentor: Prof. Subhojoy Gupta<br>
  The Bounded Distortion Conjecture proposed by R.C. Penner for (punctured) oriented surfaces relates a combinatorial method (convex-hull construction) with a complex analytic method (using Jenkins-Strebel differentials) which partitions the Teichmüller space into ideal cells. <br>
  Currently, we are near completing our calculations to conclude the conjecture for a once-punctured Torus. We are using extremal lengths to lower bound the distortion and *easy-to-compute models* of marked-Riemann surfaces for our calculations. Using branched covers, we can also conclude the conjecture for all once-punctured surfaces, if it turns out to be false for the once-punctured torus.
  
- **Two perspectives at the Weil-Petersson metric on the Teichmüller space**  
  Mentor: Prof. Sumio Yamada<br>
  I learnt about two *equivalent* ways to define the WP metric using two models of the Teichmüller space: as the space of complex structures and the space of hyperbolic metrics up to isotopy. These two ways are equivalent in the sense that one can go back and forth from one description to another during each step, showing their equivalence. 

### Bachelor's Thesis
- **Decorated Teichmüller theory: Towards the Bounded Distortion Conjecture**
  Mentor: Prof. Subhojoy Gupta<br>
  In my Bachelor's thesis, I presented an overview of this conjecture and described it through an *algorithmic perspective*. The Bounded Distortion Conjecture proposed by R.C. Penner for (punctured) oriented surfaces concerns the distortion during the translation from one model to another model of an ideal-cell decomposition of the Teichmüller space. One decomposition is obtained from a combinatorial construction (convex-hull construction) and the other from a complex analytic method (using Jenkins-Strebel differentials).
